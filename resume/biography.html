  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Jay, and I'm a newly-enrolled Computer Science (IT Management) student at MassBay Community College. I am currently in my first year of taking this major, and have plans of getting a four-year degree. I chose this class because web design is crucial in today's world - therefore knowing the fundamentals would be both helpful and interesting.</p>
